# conda-env-inspect Phase 1 Completion

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Project Setup
- Created a new Rust project with Cargo
- Set up the project structure with appropriate modules
- Added necessary dependencies in Cargo.toml

### 2. Core Functionality
- Implemented data structures to represent Conda environments
- Created parsers for environment.yml and .conda files
- Built package parsing logic that extracts names, versions, and channels
- Added pinned version detection

### 3. CLI Interface
- Built a command-line interface with clap
- Implemented subcommands for analyzing and exporting
- Added options for different output formats
- Created user-friendly help messages

### 4. Output Formats
- Implemented terminal table output
- Added JSON export functionality
- Created Markdown report generation

### 5. Documentation
- Added inline documentation with rustdoc comments
- Created a comprehensive README.md
- Added example environment files for testing

## Example Usage

The tool can now:
- Parse environment.yml files
- List all packages and their versions
- Identify pinned package versions
- Format output in table, JSON, or Markdown formats

## Next Steps for Phase 2

1. **Package Analysis Improvements**
   - Implement size calculation for packages
   - Add outdated package detection (requires Conda repository API)
   - Improve version comparison logic

2. **Conda Integration**
   - Integrate with Conda's API for richer information
   - Query package repositories for latest versions

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Create dependency visualizations
   - Add recommendations for environment optimization
   - Implement vulnerability checking

4. **Testing**
   - Add unit and integration tests
   - Create more complex test environment files
